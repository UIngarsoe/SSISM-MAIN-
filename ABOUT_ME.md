## Guiding Principles

1. **Deterministic Sovereignty**: Own your choices; ensure your actions do not harm others.
2. **Karunā and Upekkhā**: Compassion and equanimity in decision-making.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Never stop exploring mathematics, philosophy, or technology.

## Invitation

If you are curious, brave, and willing to learn, join me in exploring systems that **merge mathematics with morality**. Together, we can build tools that are not only intelligent but wise.
