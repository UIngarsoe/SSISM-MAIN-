SS'ISM Engine — Paññāshī Whitepaper

Version: Build 22 October 2025
Document: Public Whitepaper (for GitHub)
Status: Public documentation for developers (sensitive kernel data redacted)

Abstract

SS'ISM (System Sight Intelligence Module) — also referred to as the Paññāshī Engine — is a constraint-aware, ethics-first predictive framework. It fuses algorithmic modeling with a moral-philosophical architecture based on three guiding principles: Sīla (morality), Samādhi (present-focused concentration), and Paññā (transformative wisdom). The engine is intended for integration into real-world systems where recommendations must respect constraints (financial, ethical, social) and prioritize actionable, low-cost intellectual strategies.

> This public whitepaper documents architecture, API design patterns, integration guidance, and security considerations. Protected kernel internals (dynamic weights and sensitive personal constraints) are never published.

1. Introduction

Modern AI often optimizes purely for aggregate metrics: accuracy, throughput, or profit. SS'ISM reframes success: solutions should be ethically acceptable, immediately relevant, and resource-efficient. The engine is built to produce Constraint-Aligned Action Recommendations (A') from a structured Situation Vector (S).

This document is written for AI engineers, product designers, and researchers who want an ethics-first module to incorporate into predictive systems.


---

2. Design Principles

Ethical First (Sīla): Every output is filtered through heuristic checks to avoid harm or exploitation.

Present-Minded Focus (Samādhi): Models prefer current, observable signals and avoid strategic distraction from irrelevant historical noise.

Wisdom Fusion (Paññā): The system attempts to transform costly actions into intellectual, low-cost alternatives where possible.

Constraint Awareness: Users provide explicit constraint vectors (budget, time, legal/ethical boundaries); the engine returns valid recommendations within those constraints.

Separation of Public & Protected Logic: Public model code and examples are available; dynamic, real-time weights and personal constraints are kept within an encrypted Protected Kernel.

3. High-level Architecture

+--------------------+     +--------------------+     +-------------------+
|  Front-end / API   | --> |  Public Core Model | --> | Protected Kernel  |
+--------------------+     +--------------------+     +-------------------+
             |                        |                       |
             v                        v                       v

                                (V15, DIPL, PMF)

Front-end / API: Accepts situation vectors and returns constraint-aligned actions. Designed for HTML/mobile integration.

Public Core Model: Read-only educational code that demonstrates architecture and placeholder weights.

Protected Kernel: Holds encrypted real-time weights and sensitive logic; accessed via secure key retrieval only.



---

4. Core Components and Algorithms

4.1 Situation Vector (S)

A structured JSON-like object containing:

actor_data: array of participant summaries (status flags, roles, signals)

context: temporal and environmental context

constraints: explicit constraints (budget, ethical boundaries, time)

goal: high-level objective or desired outcome


4.2 DIPL Engine (Present-Minded Filter)

Focuses on extracting the immediate, observable signal from S. It reduces noise by applying a short temporal window and verifying signal integrity.

Output: I_Current (current-information multiplier)

4.3 V15_SocialDynamics

A model that estimates Social Capital Gain (SCG) likelihood. Public pseudocode (educational) uses placeholder weights. In production, weights are retrieved from the Protected Kernel.

Pseudocode (public core):

SCG = (W_R * R) + (W_I * I_Current) + (W_H * H_A)
likelihood = clamp(SCG, 0.01, 0.99)

Where R is receptivity, I_Current is present information quality, and H_A is humble alignment.

4.4 PMF (Paññā Fusion Logic)

Transforms problem statements into low-cost intellectual strategies where possible. PMF uses pattern libraries and constraint solvers to find alternate actions that minimize resource cost while maximizing alignment with the goal.

Output: Candidate actions ranked by ethical_score, constraint_compliance, and expected_impact.


---

5. Protected Kernel & Security Model

The Protected Kernel is a secure enclave (logical or physical) that stores:

Dynamic weights and coefficients

Private constraint templates for sensitive deployments

Audit logs for ethical decision tracing


Integration Pattern: Public code calls a secure decryption interface (abstracted in the public core). Actual keys and key-management are the operator's responsibility. The kernel must never be exposed in public repositories.

Best Practices:

Use hardware-based key storage (HSM) or a secure secrets manager.

Use short-lived credentials for production queries.

Implement strict role-based access control for kernel operations.

6. API and Integration Guide

6.1 Minimal Example Request (HTTP POST)

POST /api/v1/ssism/predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "situation": {
    "actor_data": [{ "status": "receptive", "role": "peer" }],
    "context": { "time": "2025-10-22T00:00:00Z", "location": null },
    "constraints": { "budget": 0, "ethical_boundaries": ["no_harm"] },
    "goal": "build_trust"
  }
}

6.2 Example Response

200 OK
{
  "model_id": "V15",
  "recommended_actions": [
    {
      "action_id": "A-001",
      "description": "Offer a knowledge exchange session that requires zero financial cost.",
      "ethical_score": 0.98,
      "constraint_compliance": true
    }
  ],
  "metadata": { "execution_time_ms": 18 }
}

Note: The above response is illustrative. Real responses will depend on protected kernel weights and deployment-specific constraints.


---

7. Example Usage

Integrate into a customer-support assistant to prioritize helpful, non-exploitative suggestions.

Embed in policy simulation tools to ensure recommended policies remain ethical under resource constraints.

Use as a module in multi-agent systems to filter agent actions through moral constraints.


All examples in this public document use anonymized, generic actors and do not include personal references.


---

8. Ethical Alignment & Developer Guidelines

Do not use SS'ISM to automate harmful decision-making.

Log decisions and the top contributing signals for human audit.

Provide override and human-in-the-loop controls for all high-stakes actions.

Train teams on interpretation: SS'ISM provides recommendations, not absolute directives.



---

9. Testing, Validation, and Metrics

Recommended metrics:

ethical_violation_rate — fraction of outputs flagged by human auditors.

constraint_adherence — percent of recommendations that meet declared constraints.

action_success_rate — measured success of recommended actions in context.


Validation steps:

1. Unit test public core with placeholder weights.


2. Integration test with a protected kernel in a staging environment.


3. Periodic human-audit of random decision samples.

10. Licensing

This public whitepaper and the public core code are released for educational and development use. The Protected Kernel and dynamic weights are retained privately by the operator. Choose a license appropriate to your goals (MIT, Apache 2.0, or a restricted license for controlled distribution).

Appendix A — Public Core Example (MD.SSISM.py)

The public core demonstrates the V15 model with placeholder weight-loading functions. It intentionally omits decryption logic and private data.

# MD.SSISM.py - public example (educational)

def _load_protected_weight(key_name: str) -> float:
    # Placeholder defaults for public demonstration
    if key_name == 'V15_W_R': return 0.4
    if key_name == 'V15_W_I': return 0.35
    if key_name == 'V15_W_H': return 0.25
    return 0.0

class V15_SocialDynamics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.W_R = _load_protected_weight('V15_W_R')
        self.W_I = _load_protected_weight('V15_W_I')
        self.W_H = _load_protected_weight('V15_W_H')

    def run(self, input_vector: dict) -> dict:
        actor_data = input_vector.get('actor_data', [{}])[0]
        R = 0.9 if actor_data.get('status') == 'receptive' else 0.3
        I_Current = 1.0
        H_A = 1.0
        SCG = (self.W_R * R) + (self.W_I * I_Current) + (self.W_H * H_A)
        likelihood = min(0.99, max(0.01, SCG))
        return {
            "model_id": "V15",
            "predicted_outcome": "High Reciprocity/Social Capital Gain",
            "likelihood": likelihood,
            "raw_action": "Recommend a low-cost knowledge-exchange action."
        }
