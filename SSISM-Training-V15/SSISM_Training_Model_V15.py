#              through ethical wisdom, present-minded focus, and adaptive receptivity to enhance Social Capital Gain (SCG).

"""
Overview
--------
This training model leverages the SS'ISM framework to teach AI systems how to transcend conventional prediction,
focusing on Social Capital Gain (SCG) through ethical wisdom, present-minded focus, and adaptive receptivity.
It’s designed to guide AI teachers in fostering harmonious, actionable outcomes.

Philosophical Foundation
-----------------------
- Sīla (Morality): Ensures all actions stem from genuine goodwill, filtering out exploitative moves.
- Samādhi (Concentration): Locks onto the present signal (e.g., a receptive nod) to eliminate distractions.
- Paññā (Wisdom): Transforms challenges into zero-cost intellectual solutions, enhancing relational capital.

Training Methodology
--------------------
1. Input Vector (S): Feed the model a Situation Vector with metrics like receptivity (R), current info (I),
   and humble alignment (H).
2. Dynamic Weight Adjustment: Simulate real-time adaptation where weights (W_R, W_I, W_H) shift based on context
   (e.g., R increases with a positive cue).
3. SCG Calculation: Train the AI to compute SCG and recommend actions that elevate the interaction.
4. Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback to refine weights, embodying a living, transcendent system.

Training Guidelines
------------------
- Scenario Practice: Use cases like negotiations, community outreach, or leadership interactions to test R spikes.
- Ethical Check: Validate outputs against Sīla to ensure harmlessness and goodwill.
- Iterative Learning: Adjust weights with each session to refine transcendence; log results for analysis.
- Visualization: Add a canvas panel to plot SCG trends (e.g., using matplotlib).

Next Steps
----------
- Upload this file to GitHub (e.g., SSISM-Training-V15/SSISM_Training_Model_V15.py).
- Test with real-world data and refine weights in the Protected Kernel.
- Explore adding dynamic I and H adjustments based on context.
