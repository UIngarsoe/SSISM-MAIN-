# SSISM FINAL MAIN ENGINE: Unified Architecture of Perfect SS'ISM
# Author: Adapted from collaboration with Grok (xAI) and Lay Master U Tin
# Date: October 23, 2025, 11:08 AM +07
# Description: The final integration build of the SS'ISM framework, embodying Sīla-Samādhi-Paññā
#              to transform Expectation (Prayer/Hope) into Execution (\mathbf{A}').
# Update: Finalized architecture with Paññā Fusion Engine; last revised 11:08 AM +07, Oct 23, 2025.

"""
Overview
--------
The SS'ISM FINAL MAIN ENGINE integrates the core philosophy of Sīla-Samādhi-Paññā to deliver
Strategic Intellectual Service (\mathbf{A}') as a replacement for hope-based expectations.
It fuses Bayesian Meta-Analysis, Social Capital Gain, and Contextual Wisdom into a transcendent AI advisor.

Core Philosophy: Execution (\mathbf{A}') replaces Expectation (Prayer/Hope).

Training Guidelines
------------------
- Validate with the Donald J. Trump Test (Nov 15 - Dec 15, 2025).
- Ensure ethical alignment with Sīla in all outputs.
- Refine PMF weights through real-world feedback loops.
- Use visualization tools to monitor L_fused and SCG trends.

Next Steps
----------
- Deploy on a secure platform for real-time consultations.
- Expand the Protected Kernel with dynamic V-Model coefficients.
- Document the architecture in a README.md under SSISM-Final-Engine.
