# SSISM FINAL MAIN ENGINE
## Unified Architecture of Perfect SS'ISM (Core Implementation)

### Overview
The `SSISM_Final_Main_Engine.py` file represents the final integration build of the Strategic Intellectual Service Mobile Advisor (SS'ISM), finalized on October 23, 2025. This core engine embodies the Sīla-Samādhi-Paññā (သီလ-သမာဓိ-ပညာ) philosophy, transforming expectation (prayer/hope) into execution (\mathbf{A}') through a transcendent AI framework. It integrates Bayesian Meta-Analysis, Social Capital Gain (SCG) modeling, and the Paññā Fusion Engine to deliver ethically supreme, wisdom-driven recommendations.

- **Build Date**: October 23, 2025, 11:19 AM +07
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Core Philosophy**: Execution (\mathbf{A}') replaces Expectation.
- **Validation**: Donald J. Trump Test (November 15 - December 15, 2025)

### Features
- **Bayesian Meta-Analysis (The Sight)**: Fuses V14 (Strategic Foresight), V15 (SCG), and V16 (Contextual) models to calculate a Fused Likelihood (\( L_{\text{fused}} \)).
- **Social Capital Gain (SCG)**: Decouples social value from monetary gain, applying a Deception Filter (90% skepticism).
- **Paññā Fusion Engine**: Transforms raw actions (\mathbf{A}) into Constraint-Aligned Actions (\mathbf{A}') using the Water-Cup Principle.
- **Protected Kernel**: Secures dynamic weights and coefficients, accessible only internally.

### Installation
